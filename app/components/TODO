find out why student's name is 'undefined' when the name was literally just console.logged, and updated in the database
I think it's something to do with the async chaining not working

figure out how to wait for the campus/student to be created before updating the state
fix form bug on create student

make a seperate change campus component.
make a seperate drop student componenet
